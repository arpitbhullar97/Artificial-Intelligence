# Artificial-Intelligence
This project was about using pycaret to test different models and use the best model to predict the results of a chess game, a very specific chess game where it has a situation of king-rook vs king-pawn i.e. the pawn on a7 which is one step away from queening, and, it is king-rook 's (white's) turn to make the move. We have a dataset of 3196 rows in which each row corresponds to a set of 36 moves before the outcome of the game can be judged, which is the 37th column giving us a result if white wins or looses. We split this data into train set (2876 records) and test set (320 records). The pycaret environment is setup and the best model predicted for the train set is Decision Tree Classifier. We are using classification here because the outcome is two classes/categories and not numerical. Then we evaluate the and compare the accuracy results on both test and train datasets which are almost identical (~94%). This assures us that the selected model is accurate for predicting the results for any other unseen data and this model can be saved and used later on to make similar predictions in other environments.
